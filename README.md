# Larris Library

**Larris Library** is a custom WordPress theme for creating a library website to save and display book collections. It is simple, fast, and easy to set up.

## Introduction
This theme registers custom pages and metadata directly within the theme for simplicity and speed. While this works, it is **not best practice**. In a production environment, custom post types and metadata should ideally be created via a **plugin** for better maintainability and portability. This theme is a quick starting point for building a library site.
