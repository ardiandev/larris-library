# Larris Library

**Larris Library** is a custom WordPress theme designed to create a library website for saving and displaying book collections. It allows users to easily organize, manage, and showcase books with a clean and intuitive interface. The theme is lightweight and optimized for fast loading, making it suitable for small to medium-sized library websites.

## Introduction
This theme includes custom pages and metadata registered directly within the theme for simplicity and speed. While this approach works, it is **not considered best practice**. In a production environment, it is recommended to register custom post types and metadata via a **plugin** to ensure better portability, maintainability, and adherence to WordPress standards.

The theme provides a flexible structure that can be easily extended to include additional features such as book ratings, categories, and author profiles. It is ideal for developers who want a starting point for building a fully-featured library website. Users can quickly deploy the theme and start adding book collections without extensive setup.
